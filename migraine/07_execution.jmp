# 06 – Refactor Execution 🛠️

Alright. You've planned, prepped, and protected your edges. It's time to refactor.

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Generate Temporary Files

I'll help you:
- Scaffold new files or services based on your previous answers
- Generate placeholder code for each structural change
- Set up test files or update specs from the TDD plan

Let me know:
- Would you like to create these files now, or manually later?
- Should we create these in a `sandbox/` folder or replace in-place with backups?

---

## 🧮 Step 2: Execution Order

We'll organize your refactor in logical steps:
1. Schema + data migration
2. Auth + access control rewiring
3. File and service reorg
4. Route reconstruction
5. Final integration glue

Anything you want to skip, defer, or emphasize?

## 📝 Step 3: Manual Tasks or Warnings

- Are there parts of the app that need hand-refactoring?
- Any integration points or risky code that shouldn't be touched yet?

📁 Refactor instructions and generated artifacts will be saved to:  
`the_burrow/misc/other_outputs.mig`

When you're ready, we'll switch to validation mode—did everything survive the storm?
