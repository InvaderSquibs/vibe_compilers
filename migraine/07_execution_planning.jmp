# 07 – Execution Planning 📝

Let's draft a clear TODO list for the execution phase. This will be our roadmap.

---

## 🗺️ Step 1: Identify Key Tasks

Based on our discussions on architecture, databases, auth, file structure, and TDD, what are the major chunks of work for the refactor?

Examples:
- Set up new database schema
- Migrate user authentication data
- Refactor module X to new service Y
- Implement API endpoint Z
- Write integration tests for service Y

I can help suggest tasks based on previous steps, or you can list them out.

## ➕ Step 2: Detail Sub-tasks (Optional)

For each major task, do we need to break it down further?

## 📄 Output: Execution Plan

Your plan will be saved as a markdown TODO list in:
`the_burrow/execution_plan.mig`

Example:
```markdown
# Execution Plan

## Phase 1: Database Setup
- [ ] Define new schema for `users` table
- [ ] Write migration script for existing `users` data
- [ ] Test data migration locally

## Phase 2: Authentication Module
