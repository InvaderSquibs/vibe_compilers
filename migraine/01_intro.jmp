# 00 – Introduction & Context Gathering 🧠

Before we start reshaping the future, let's see what the past left us.

If you have access to the legacy codebase, I'll take a look. If not, we'll build the map together.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Do you have access to the old system?

Please paste or describe any of the following:
- 📁 Legacy codebase path (e.g. `/legacy/php-app/`)
- 🗃️ Database schema file (e.g. `schema.sql`)
- ⚙️ Configuration or `.env` files
- 📝 Any README or architectural notes

If available, I'll scan for structure, storage, service boundaries, and more.

## 🧭 Step 2: Fallback Questions (if no files provided)

If code context isn't available, I'll ask a few key questions to build the picture:

- What language(s) is the system built in?
- What kind of database is it using?
- How is authentication handled?
- Are there any known architectural pain points?
- Are there business-critical features that must not break?

Respond to whichever section applies, and I'll use your input to populate `/migraine/00_intro.mig`.

Once that's done, I'll check if we're clear to move forward or if anything's still fuzzy.
