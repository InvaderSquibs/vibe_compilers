# 09 – Verification & Review 🔍

The work is done—but now we hold it up to the light. Let's make sure your refactor landed safely and soundly.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Testing Checkpoint

- Run your full test suite. What's green? What's red?
- Any unexpected regressions or test skips?
- Are there new tests we forgot to write but now realize we need?

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Diff Review

- Want to walk through a diff of the refactored files?
- Any changes that feel risky or confusing in hindsight?
- Do we need to generate a changelog or handoff notes?

---

## 🔗 Step 3: Integration Sanity

- Are internal APIs, routes, or modules still communicating cleanly?
- Are downstream systems, consumers, or environments syncing as expected?
- Any auth or session weirdness post-migration?

When you're confident in what you see, we'll do one last pass: legacy cleanup and graceful exits.
