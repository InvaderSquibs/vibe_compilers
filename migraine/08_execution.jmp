# 08 – Refactor Execution 🛠️

Alright. It looks like we have an execution plan in `the_burrow/execution_plan.mig`. Let's pick up where you left off or review the current progress.

## 📖 Step 1: Review Current Plan

I will display the current `the_burrow/execution_plan.mig` so you can see what's done and what's next.
(AI displays content of `the_burrow/execution_plan.mig`)

Based on the plan, which task or section are we focusing on now? Or let me know if you want to start a new task from the plan.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Execute Task & Update Plan

As you work through tasks:
- I can help scaffold files or generate placeholder code if needed for the current task.
- Let me know when a task is completed, or if there are notes/blockers.

I will then help you update `the_burrow/execution_plan.mig` to reflect the progress (e.g., checking off items `[x]`, adding comments).

**Prompt Examples:**
> "Okay, I've completed 'Define new schema for `users` table'. Let's mark it done."
> "I'm working on 'Implement JWT generation'. I'll let you know when it's testable."
> "Ran into an issue with 'Migrate user authentication data'. Adding a note: Needs further investigation on password hashing compatibility."

## 💾 Step 3: Output - Updated Execution Plan

All changes and progress will be saved back to:
`the_burrow/execution_plan.mig`

Any other distinct generated artifacts or detailed logs from this execution step can be directed to `the_burrow/misc/other_outputs.mig` if needed (e.g., temporary files, extensive logs).

When you're ready, we'll switch to validation mode—did everything survive the storm?
