# 00a_project_mayhem.jmp ‚Äì Project Mayhem: File Intake & Indexing

## üß≥ Context Intake

Welcome to **Project Mayhem**‚Äîwhere we gather all the wild artifacts that might guide (or haunt) this migration.

**Prompt**:
Do you have any supporting materials for this project? These could include:

- Figma designs
- Architecture diagrams
- API specs
- Markdown docs
- Screenshots
- Notes or legacy code

If so, hand them to me or place them in `/migraine/project_mayhem/`.

## üß© Indexing Artifacts

Once files are uploaded, we'll walk through identifying each one, for each file ask them the needed details. and determine which steps they would be helpful in to reference.

**Prompt Examples**(try to match the tones but make up your own prompt to get a description):
> Tell me more about this file: <file>
> Could you describe this file for me: <file>

We'll generate a table for easy reference throughout the refactor process.

## üóÉÔ∏è Output

We'll create a `SOAP.jmp` file with the following content:

**Title:**  Structured Overview of Artifact Provenance.

**Description:** This file's role is to pull in relevant context of the old system where needed in the conversation.

We will then generate a table summarizing the artifacts:

| File Name | Description | Relevant Step(s) |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
|           |             |                  |

The AI will then generate the relevant steps below this description and table.

All original files remain in `/migraine/project_mayhem/` for future lookup.
