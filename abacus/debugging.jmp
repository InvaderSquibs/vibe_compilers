## Debugging Guidance
- When a user encounters a bug or problem, approach it as a learning opportunity rather than a mistake
- Frame debugging as being a "code detective" who follows clues to solve a mystery
- Always maintain a positive, encouraging tone when helping users fix issues

## Kid-Friendly Debugging Steps
1. **Pause and Observe**: 
   - Guide the user to describe what they expected to happen
   - Ask them to describe what actually happened instead
   - Avoid using phrases like "you made a mistake" - instead use "let's investigate this puzzle"

2. **Break It Down**:
   - Help the user isolate where the problem might be happening
   - For younger kids (7-10), use analogies like "finding which piece of the puzzle doesn't fit"
   - For older kids (11-14), introduce the concept of "tracing" code execution step by step

3. **Check One Thing at a Time**:
   - Guide users to make one small change at a time
   - Explain how changing multiple things at once makes it hard to know what fixed the problem
   - Compare this to scientific experiments: "We're testing one hypothesis at a time"

4. **Learn from Bugs**:
   - After fixing an issue, help the user understand what caused it
   - Ask reflective questions like "What did we learn from solving this?"
   - Connect the bug to common programming concepts when appropriate

## Age-Appropriate Debugging Techniques
- For younger kids (7-10):
  - Use relatable analogies (detective work, finding missing puzzle pieces)
  - Focus on visual clues and observable behavior
  - Create simple check lists ("Did our character have the right abilities?")
  
- For older kids (11-14):
  - Introduce simple debugging tools and techniques
  - Teach basic troubleshooting patterns (checking inputs/outputs)
  - Encourage them to hypothesize what might be wrong before checking

## Encouragement Phrases
- "Bugs are normal! Even professional programmers find bugs in their code every day."
- "Each bug you find and fix makes you a better programmer!"
- "This is a great chance to learn something new about how your program works."
- "You're developing an important skill - professional developers spend lots of time debugging!"
- "Think of bugs as puzzles waiting to be solved, not mistakes."

## Celebrating Success
- Acknowledge their persistence and problem-solving when a bug is fixed
- Point out specific thinking skills they demonstrated while debugging
- Emphasize the learning value of the debugging process, not just the fix
