# PyGame Compiler

Welcome to the PyGame Compiler! You’re about to build your very own 2D game using Python and the PyGame library.

This compiler is best for projects that involve:
- Characters or objects moving around the screen
- Keyboard or controller input
- Scoreboards, animations, or level designs
- Arcade-style games or side scrollers

## Compilation Process
Once you have a complete `main.abc` file, use the information to generate a Python game project structured as follows:

(game_name)/
├── main.py
├── assets/
│ ├── images/
│ └── sounds/
├── config.py
└── README.md


### Step-by-step:
1. Create `main.py` with the main game loop, window setup, and game logic.
2. Use `config.py` to store constants like screen size, frame rate, and colors.
3. Include placeholder assets and instructions for replacing them in `README.md`.
4. Keep code commented for readability—especially for young or new programmers.

### Additional Guidelines
- Prefer functions and small classes to keep logic clean.
- Use inline comments to explain concepts like collision detection or sprite animation.
- If user specifies controller input, include example code using `pygame.joystick`.

Let’s turn their ideas into something they can play—and share!
