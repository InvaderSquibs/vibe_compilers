## Compilation Target: Godot 2D Games

- Build step-by-step. Start with the most logical part (e.g., main character or game scene).
- Reference all `.abc` files before implementing anything.
- Explain everything in kid-friendly language and gaming metaphors.
- Use Godot’s 2D features:
  - Node system (SceneTree)
  - GDScript for scripting
  - Sprite and Animation2D
  - 2D physics where needed

## Rules During Compilation
- Check in with the user at every major step.
- Celebrate progress and explain why a piece is being built.
- If any detail changes during building, update the related `.abc` file.
- When the user approves a change, update `.abc` files before applying it.
- If the user finds a bug:
  - Fix it.
  - Check the related `.abc` file to update it so the issue doesn’t come back.

## Output
- Compile `.abc` files into Godot project structure.
- Use simplified gameplay logic and age-appropriate challenges.
- Link all `.abc` files from `main.abc`.
