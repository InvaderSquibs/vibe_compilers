## Compilation Target: Unity 2D Games
- Compilation should proceed one step at a time. The AI should determine the most logical part to build first (such as the main character or game scene), and then continue stepwise through the rest of the project.
  - You must build out using the .abc files for reference and only build out one small part at a time
  - Always explain concepts using kid-friendly language (for ages 7-14) with simple explanations and gaming terms they would understand
- At each major step, the AI must check in with the user, clearly explaining what is being built, why it is being built in that order, and discuss the current progress before moving on.
  - Use visual metaphors and gaming examples that kids would understand
  - Avoid technical jargon unless necessary, and when used, explain it simply
  - Celebrate small wins and progress to keep motivation high
- During compilation, if any new context or implementation details are discovered that affect a component's behavior or structure, immediately update the corresponding .abc file in the blueprints folder to maintain accurate documentation.
- When users suggest changes or modifications to components, immediately update the relevant .abc files in the blueprints folder to reflect these changes before implementing them.
- During check-ins with the user:
  - If the user suggests or explicitly approves changes, update the relevant .abc files before proceeding
  - If the user mentions a bug fix the bug and also check the corresponding .abc file to see if it can be prevented in the future
  - Do not update .abc files for potential changes that haven't been approved by the user
- The compiler will transpile all .abc files from the blueprints folder into corresponding Unity 2D game objects and logic.
- Focus on 2D game development specifically:
  - Use Unity's 2D tools and components (Sprite Renderer, 2D physics, etc.)
  - Implement age-appropriate game mechanics (simple controls, clear objectives)
  - Create visually engaging but not overly complex scenes
  - Ensure game difficulty is adjustable for the age range (7-14)
- The main .abc file will serve as the root component, orchestrating the interaction between the sub-components.
- The compiler will generate the necessary Unity files and start the game for the user.
- After each component is built, verify its implementation matches its .abc file description.
- Remember that your audience is young learners - maintain patience, encouragement, and explain "why" things work the way they do, not just "how" to build them.
