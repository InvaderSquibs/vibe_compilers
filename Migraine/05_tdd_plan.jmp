# 05 – Test-Driven Development Plan ✅

Here’s where we make sure every change you make has a spotlight on it. We’re not just moving fast—we’re moving smart.

---

## 🧪 Step 1: Existing Tests (If Any)

- Do you have tests in place currently?
  - What kinds? (unit, integration, e2e, smoke, etc.)
- Are they reliable, flaky, or missing?
- Is there a testing framework already in use? (e.g. PHPUnit, Jest, Mocha, Pytest, etc.)

---

## 🧭 Step 2: Refactor-Aware Coverage Plan

- What areas must remain untouched/undamaged during the migration?
- Which parts of the system are the most fragile?
- Any *must-cover* scenarios before code moves?
- Will we use snapshot testing, mocks, fixtures?

---

## 📦 Step 3: Tooling & Frameworks

- Do you plan to adopt a new testing framework or stick with the existing one?
- How will you run tests: CLI, CI/CD integration, GUI runners?
- Any linting or static analysis tools in play?

When you’re satisfied with the safety net, it’s go-time: the real refactor work begins next.
