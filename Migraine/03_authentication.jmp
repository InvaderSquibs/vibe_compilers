# 03 – Authentication & Authorization 🔐

Time to define who gets in, who gets what, and how we keep it all secure.

---

## 🧓 Step 1: Legacy Auth Overview

- How is authentication currently handled? (e.g. sessions, tokens, OAuth, custom login?)
- Where are user credentials stored?
- Are there roles, permissions, or access control levels built in?
- Any identity provider integrations (LDAP, SSO, Auth0, Firebase, etc.)?

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Target Model

- Are you keeping the current approach or planning a new one?
- Planning to move to JWTs, OAuth2, biometric auth, or passwordless?
- Will auth be handled in-app or by an external service?
- Are there new permission models you want to add (e.g. scopes, claims, RBAC/ABAC)?

---

## 🛡️ Step 3: Security & Compatibility

- Any password reset, MFA, or account recovery flows that need rework?
- Are you migrating existing users? If so, can you preserve password hashes?
- Will legacy tokens or sessions still need to work during transition?

From here, we’ll get structural—next up is file layout, routes, and how you organize the bones of your beast.
