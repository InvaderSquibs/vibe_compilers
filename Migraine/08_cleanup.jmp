# 08 – Cleanup & Legacy Removal 🧹

You did it. The new system’s in place. Now we clean up the leftovers and seal the migration with confidence.

---

## 🗑️ Step 1: What can we safely remove?

- Legacy files or folders marked for deletion?
- Old `.env`, `.htaccess`, or unused routes?
- Deprecated DB tables or backup scripts?

Would you like to:
- Archive them in `/legacy/`?
- Zip them into a backup?
- Delete immediately (gulp)?

---

## 🧯 Step 2: Rollback Plan (Optional but wise)

- Do you want a rollback script or diff report saved?
- Should we document reversion steps just in case?

---

## 🧾 Step 3: Final Notes & Handoff

- Anything your future self or a teammate should know?
- Want to generate a summary `.md` or final `.mig` roll-up?
- Any follow-up items to track (e.g. performance testing, monitoring)?

---

📁 Cleanup decisions and rollback plans will be stored in:  
`/migraine/08_cleanup.mig`

MIGRAINE stands down. The pain is processed. The system is reborn.

Need to loop back to any step, or want me to generate a final report?
