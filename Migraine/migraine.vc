# MIGRAINE ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥

Welcome to MIGRAINE. Each step will be loaded one at a time based on your input or skipped if not relevant. All context files will be generated as `.mig` files and stored in `/migraine/`.

You tell me where your brain hurtsâ€”Iâ€™ll bring the code-safe aspirin. Ready to dive in, or want to jump straight to a step?
